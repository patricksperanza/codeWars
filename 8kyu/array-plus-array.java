// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

// P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

public class Sum {

  public static int arrayPlusArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int num : arr1) {
    sum += num;
    }
    for(int num : arr2) {
    sum += num;
    }
    return sum;
  }

}
